### Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Å Ã¡lek ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from PurkyÅˆova high school focus on Information Technology. I'm looking for full-time opportunities/job in programming.

 Currently I'm learning mainly C# and SQL with a goal to start contributing to open source projects. Sometimes I try create project in Javascript.
 I have knowledge of computer networking because I had the opportunity to go through Cisco courses and also I have Linux experience.

When I'm not programming I enjoy reading,basketball and learning about computers.
